## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm Puneet!  
I’m a Senior Software Engineer specialized in ADAS, infotainment verification and validation, automation, and autonomous vehicles, recently completed an MSc in Big Data Science at Queen Mary University of London and currently based in Rugby, UK.

🔭 I’m currently working on applied ML projects across ADAS scenario validation, EV power electronics condition monitoring, and scalable data analytics.​
🌱 I’m passionate about using ML to improve automotive safety, reliability, and user experience across mobility systems.​
💡 Skilled in Python, C, C++, TensorFlow, Scikit‑learn, PySpark, Robot Framework, Jenkins, CANoe, dSPACE, Power BI, MATLAB/Simulink, and Linux tooling.​
📫 How to reach me: puneetpal.tech@gmail.com | LinkedIn: puneetpal3. ​
⚡ Fun fact: Captained a state‑level basketball team, won an air‑pistol shooting event, and completed a pre‑mountaineering course.

## 🔬 Research Journey
Academic path: transitioning from industry test‑automation leadership into applied ML research in mobility and power electronics.​

Goal: leveraging ML for ADAS validation, EV device health monitoring, and data‑driven QA at scale.​

Current work: MSc projects on SiC MOSFET condition monitoring, autonomous driving control with CNNs, and big‑data pipelines with PySpark.
